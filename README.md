# ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly <br> on GitHub Pages

It turns out compiling a Blazor WASM project for static hosting works perfectly 
fine. Now, considering I'm personally a lot more comfortable in C# and Blazor
compared to other JavaScript/TypeScript based front-end frameworks like React or
Svelte, this was an opportunity I had to investigate further.
